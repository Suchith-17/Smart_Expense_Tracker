🧠 How It Works

The app uses the browser's LocalStorage to:

Store transactions

Store recurring expenses

Maintain budgets

Persist theme preference (dark/light)

Chart.js dynamically renders:

Pie chart → Expense by category (current month)

Bar chart → Income vs Expenses (last 6 months)

No backend → Secure personal usage & runs offline.
